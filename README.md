FHIM Who, What, When, Where, Why and How Overview 
The Federal Health Information Model is called FHIM. 
In 2019, the FHIM team developed this “FHIM Practitioners’ Guide” as a set of short and easily updated training presentations and videos; where, our training objective is to encourage and empower analysts’, implementers’ and developers’ efficient and effective use of FHIM. 
A comprehensive 50 minute FHIM Overview video and 10 minute executive summary video, plus six self-standing FHIM deep-dive topics’ were produced. 
FHIM Overview - Executive Summary

The “FHIM overview” presentations and videos follow the Journalistic Who, What, Where, When, Why and How, approach to help give a clear, complete, concise correct and consistent description of the FHIM fundamentals; where, each question has a 5 to 10 minute deep-dive factual answer that is intended to help analysts, implementers and developers to quickly understand FHIM concepts and use. Importantly, none of these questions can be answered with a simple "yes" or "no“. The six questions are:
1. Who is on the FHIM Team? Where, the FHIM points of contact, their roles and their organizations are presented.  
2. What is FHIM?  Where, briefly 
FHIM is a logical health information model that supports semantic interoperability and harmonizes healthcare information requirements from federal partners and standards organizations
Second, FHIM provides an integrated picture of a healthcare information model and standards information plus standard reference terminologies. 
Third, FHIM has companion model driven development architectural  and implementation tools. These tools help an analyst implementer or informaticist to design and develop applications using quality consistent information and requirements traceable HL7 standards such as FIRE C-CDA and V2 profiles and extensions.
Fourth, FHIM supports the specification of Electronic Healthcare Records, and serves as the blueprint for interoperable data in motion and date-ta at rest
Finally, FHIM empowers intra-agency and inter-agency interoperability plus  healthcare partner, contractor, academia and industry interoperability. 
3. Where are FHIM’s Collaboration Websites? Briefly, 
FHIM’s https://github.com is the official government’s FHIM repository.
The www.FHIMS.org is the unofficial FHIM Team’s collaboration website, which publishes the current FHIM version. 
4. When were the FHIM’s Milestones?  Where, briefly the key events chronology started
In 2006, the George W. Bush Presidential Executive Order 13,410 established e-government lines of business, which resulted in FHA being created and its 2008 sponsoring of the FHIM. 
The February 17, 2009 A-R-R-A HI-TAC legislation accelerated the creation and use of EHR systems. 
It resulted in the July 13, 2010 CMS Meaning-full Use policy. 
In 2015 the MACRA merit-based policies were added.. 
In December 2016 The 21st Century Cures Act mandated Patient Access to their information; where, 
the Cures Act defines interoperability as without requiring extra effort and without information blocking, with substantial penalties for non-compliance.
In January 2018 The US Healthcare, O-N-C Office of the National Coordinator for technology issued the draft  TEFCA and US-CDI regulations; where 
TEFCA defines a Trusted Exchange Framework and Common Agreement among Q-HINS, which are qualified health information exchanges managed by an R-C-E who is an ONC recognize coordinating entity 
US-CDI defines the U.S. Core Data for Interoperability 
The TEFCA and US-CDI policies are scheduled to be finalized in 2019. Finally, also
In 2019, as a part of the FHA sunset, FHIM is scheduled to be transitioned from ONC stewardship.
5. Why is FHIM valuable? Concisely, 
First, the FHIM delivers a vetted information view of the highly complex and ever changing healthcare landscape.
Where, FHIM has been created, verified and validated through collaborative Modeling and Terminology meetings with the participation of federal and industry Subject Matter Experts.
Second, the FHIM provides a single point of reference to ensure consistent updating of healthcare information requirements based on changes in healthcare laws, regulations, policies, and standards. 
Third, the FHIM offers the deep and consolidated meta information and tools needed in the coming years to build solutions that save cost and time and which positively impact patient safety and quality of care.
6. How is FHIM used? 
Implementers make healthcare IT work by solving real problems. But, what are they looking for? 
In about 1995, HL7 Version 3 developers claimed to have define a world in which point-to-point healthcare data sharing mapping wouldn't be required. 
Over 10 years of V3 usage showed that's not possible and that V3 users often have specific local use case workflow-processing needs
Since 2010 FIRE users have said the time, complexity and cost of consistent V3 semantics is too high while not meeting their local workflow needs. 
Instead, they wanted ad-hoc FIRE profiles and extension forms that are close to their domain workflow use cases. 
The FHIM team appreciates FIRE’s faster-cheaper approach when it comes to customized local workflows; 
where, local adaptation will often be required and HIN exchange is not relevant. 
Here, FHIM guidence can still help make FIRE profiles and extensions more consistent. 
FHIM has the goal to enable better enterprise and  N-HIN Nationwide HIN interoperability 
Supporting transfer-of-care and care-team management of shared patient information, such as,
Procedures, Allergies, Medications, Problems, Immunizations, Observations, test Results and Notes.
